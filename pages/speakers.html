                        <h3>Talk: Next Generation Digital Systems: The Convergence of AI, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing</h3>
                        <p>
                            The world is rapidly evolving towards a digital future, with advances in technology transforming
                            the way we live, work, and learn. The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and
                            quantum computing represents a significant leap in the development of digital systems. This talk
                            will explore the impact of these cutting-edge technologies on education, economy, finance, and
                            health.
                            AI has already started to revolutionize the education sector by offering personalized learning
                            experiences and automating administrative tasks. In the economy, AI is transforming the way we
                            work, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and automate processes. Meanwhile,
                            blockchain technology is transforming the financial sector by providing a decentralized and
                            secure platform for transactions, while quantum computing is unlocking new possibilities in areas
                            such as drug discovery and cryptography.
                            The talk will discuss the benefits and challenges associated with each of these technologies and
                            explore their potential applications in education, economy, finance, and health. Furthermore, it
                            will highlight the need for a multidisciplinary approach to harness the full potential of these
                            technologies and address ethical and societal concerns.
                            The talk will conclude by providing insights into the intersection of AI, blockchain, and quantum
                            computing and their impact on the future of digital systems. The talk will be of interest to anyone
                            interested in the future of technology and its potential to transform our lives.

                        <h3>Talk: IC Technology and computing: Past, present, and future.</h3>
                        <p>
                            No one can deny the fact that we rely heavily on electronic systems in our daily life. It is almost
                            impossible to imagine a day without your smart phone, computers, TV or even our coffee-
                            machines. Without electronics, business/work couldn&#39;t continue any more, the quality of
                            education would degenerate, and the life quality probably turn back to the 18th century.
                            Moreover, the wide spread of internet being able to generate huge data sets, combined with the
                            introduction with powerful computing platforms (e.g., GPU based) being able to deliver
                            significantly high computing throughput, have enabled the deployment of Artificial intelligence
                            (AI) starting from 2010 on. AI has now evolved into a technology that is revolutionizing the
                            world in many application domains. Electronics are made accessible and affordable for almost
                            everyone in the globe due to technology scaling, and the deployment of AI for real applications is
                            made feasible due to advances in computer architecture hardware. Nevertheless, both the
                            technology scaling and computer architectures are facing major challenges calling for new
                            innovations and breakthroughs in order sustain and extend the use of electronics and AI at large,
                            but then at affordable cost. For instance, IC scaling is making the devices less reliable, while
                            deploying AI for edge applications is extremely demanding in terms of energy efficiencies that
                            today’s computer architectures cannot deliver.
                            This talk addresses the CMOS device technology scaling as a financial model and its impact on
                            different aspects of IC, as well as emerging device technologies and their potential in enabling
                            alterative computing paradigms. The talk starts first with highlighting the fundamental invention
                            that made the electronic system a reality: from transistors to Integrated Circuits (ICs). Then, the
                            talk addresses the basics of scaling, together with its impact on integration density, performance,
                            power and in particular reliability. Thereafter, the technology outlook is analyzed in order to
                            extract future challenges, both for near and long terms. IC realization process will be (re)defined
                            while considering the technology trends and business pressure, and ways for the realization of
                            future chips will be discussed. The talk thereafter gives an overview of emerging devices and how
                            they will enable not only huge storage but also energy efficient computing paradigms needed to
                            deploy AI at large (e.g., for edge Internet-of-things (IoT) devices). The major bottlenecks of
                            today’s computer architectures will be highlighted. A classification of the sate-of-the art
                            computer architectures will be given while highlighting how the trends is going toward
                            computation-in-memory (CIM) architectures. The concept of CIM based is discussed and logic
                            and arithmetic circuit designs using such devices and how they enable such architectures are
                            covered. The strong dependency of application domains on the selection of appropriate CIM
                            architecture and its building blocks, as well as the huge potential of CIM (in realizing order of
                            magnitude improvement in terms of energy efficiency) are illustrated based on some case studies
                            and chip prototypes. Future CIM challenges including architectures, design, test, and reliability
                            are highlighted.

                        <p>
                            The main objective of this talk is to raise awareness about the existence of intercultural
                            stereotypes in AI systems and encourage critical reflection on their impact. We will examine the
                            reasons behind the occurrence of these stereotypes.
                            We will also explore the potential consequences of intercultural stereotypes generated by AI on
                            marginalized groups and the broader implications for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Concrete
                            examples and case studies will reveal existing biases and highlight the risks of perpetuating
                            harmful stereotypes in automated systems.
                            Finally, we will discuss possible strategies to mitigate these biases and utilize AI in a more ethical
                            and inclusive manner.
                            By participating in this conference, attendees will gain a better understanding of the issues related
                            to intercultural stereotypes generated by AI and will be able to contribute to informed discussions
                            and innovative solutions to promote responsible use of AI in our multicultural society.
