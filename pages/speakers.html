                        <h3>Talk: IC Technology and computing: Past, present, and future.</h3>
                        <p>
                            No one can deny the fact that we rely heavily on electronic systems in our daily life. It is almost
                            impossible to imagine a day without your smart phone, computers, TV or even our coffee-
                            machines. Without electronics, business/work couldn&#39;t continue any more, the quality of
                            education would degenerate, and the life quality probably turn back to the 18th century.
                            Moreover, the wide spread of internet being able to generate huge data sets, combined with the
                            introduction with powerful computing platforms (e.g., GPU based) being able to deliver
                            significantly high computing throughput, have enabled the deployment of Artificial intelligence
                            (AI) starting from 2010 on. AI has now evolved into a technology that is revolutionizing the
                            world in many application domains. Electronics are made accessible and affordable for almost
                            everyone in the globe due to technology scaling, and the deployment of AI for real applications is
                            made feasible due to advances in computer architecture hardware. Nevertheless, both the
                            technology scaling and computer architectures are facing major challenges calling for new
                            innovations and breakthroughs in order sustain and extend the use of electronics and AI at large,
                            but then at affordable cost. For instance, IC scaling is making the devices less reliable, while
                            deploying AI for edge applications is extremely demanding in terms of energy efficiencies that
                            today’s computer architectures cannot deliver.
                            This talk addresses the CMOS device technology scaling as a financial model and its impact on
                            different aspects of IC, as well as emerging device technologies and their potential in enabling
                            alterative computing paradigms. The talk starts first with highlighting the fundamental invention
                            that made the electronic system a reality: from transistors to Integrated Circuits (ICs). Then, the
                            talk addresses the basics of scaling, together with its impact on integration density, performance,
                            power and in particular reliability. Thereafter, the technology outlook is analyzed in order to
                            extract future challenges, both for near and long terms. IC realization process will be (re)defined
                            while considering the technology trends and business pressure, and ways for the realization of
                            future chips will be discussed. The talk thereafter gives an overview of emerging devices and how
                            they will enable not only huge storage but also energy efficient computing paradigms needed to
                            deploy AI at large (e.g., for edge Internet-of-things (IoT) devices). The major bottlenecks of
                            today’s computer architectures will be highlighted. A classification of the sate-of-the art
                            computer architectures will be given while highlighting how the trends is going toward
                            computation-in-memory (CIM) architectures. The concept of CIM based is discussed and logic
                            and arithmetic circuit designs using such devices and how they enable such architectures are
                            covered. The strong dependency of application domains on the selection of appropriate CIM
                            architecture and its building blocks, as well as the huge potential of CIM (in realizing order of
                            magnitude improvement in terms of energy efficiency) are illustrated based on some case studies
                            and chip prototypes. Future CIM challenges including architectures, design, test, and reliability
                            are highlighted.

                        <p>
                            The main objective of this talk is to raise awareness about the existence of intercultural

                            reasons behind the occurrence of these stereotypes.
                            We will also explore the potential consequences of intercultural stereotypes generated by AI on
                            marginalized groups and the broader implications for diversity, equity, and inclusion. Concrete
                            examples and case studies will reveal existing biases and highlight the risks of perpetuating
                            harmful stereotypes in automated systems.
                            Finally, we will discuss possible strategies to mitigate these biases and utilize AI in a more ethical
                            and inclusive manner.
                            By participating in this conference, attendees will gain a better understanding of the issues related
                            to intercultural stereotypes generated by AI and will be able to contribute to informed discussions
                            and innovative solutions to promote responsible use of AI in our multicultural society.

                        <p>
                            The keynote will focus on the reasons why FinTech, financial technologies, are crucial for
                            sustainable development and the measures regulators and governments should take to develop a
                            comprehensive strategy to support digital financial transformation, promoting both financial
                            inclusion and sustainable and balanced growth more broadly. It addresses the following
                            questions: why should we focus on FinTech; what is their connection to financial inclusion what
                            are the impacts of disruptive technologies on board of directors’ fiduciary duties; and what is the
                            link between FinTech for financial inclusion and sustainability, a key criterion of the United
                            Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG).
                            Economies have a vested interest in developing digital financial transformation strategies, with a
                            focus on the role of FinTech in financial inclusion, as it represents a significant potential solution
                            to the most important and challenging question: how should economies go about achieving
                            sustainable development goals? Digital financial inclusion is one of the most important answers
                            to the question of how regulators and governments should achieve the SDGs.

                            Talk: The decision: the evolution of a multidisciplinary concept</h3>
                        <p>
                            Whether it is a concept, a theory or a simple practice, whether it comes from economics, management, finance, sociology,
                            mathematics or even psychology, decision has caused many ink in the West, and this, at least since the 18th century with the famous Paradox
                            of St Petersburg by D. Bernouilli. For some researchers in the West, we can speak of decision sciences, sciences which bring together a
                            scientific community where we find mathematicians, economists, managers, anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, and many computer
                            scientists, etc. . In reality, there is no other concept that is at the crossroads of so many disciplinary fields, and that is as studied as the
                            decision. This communication proposes to retrace the evolution of this concept in an abstract way. The aim is to show that in the various
                            disciplinary fields mentioned above, there are common visions of decision-making, decision-making models underlying the theories and
                            models developed within these disciplinary fields. To do this, this communication will be organized as follows:
                            <br>
                            In a first point, we will see the classical decision model, a model underlying neoclassical economic theory, financial theory, and unicriterion
                            operational research. We will see what are the different forms it takes within these disciplinary fields, and how it itself has evolved;
                            <br>
                            Secondly, we will look at the questioning of this model by H. Simon (Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978). We will insist on two
                            consequences of this questioning. On the one hand, on the paradigm shifts that have occurred within operational research thanks to the
                            development of Multicriteria Decision Aid, and within economics thanks to the introduction of a new methodological approach that is
                            experimental economics. On the other hand, on the introduction of artificial intelligence in decision processing. We will see how the work of
                            H. Simon has a lot to do with the development of Artificial Intelligence (Gobet 2002, Pitrat 2002), and its use in decision modeling.
